<p>My name is Tyler Benziger. I am a web developer, father, and musician.</p>

<p>I work at Adobe in San Francisco on a small team that focuses on validating and prototyping new
ideas. The flexibility of my team has given me
some amazing opportunities including working on projects like <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery
Mobile</a>,
<a href="http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller">ThemeRoller</a>, and <a href="http://adobe.com/muse">Muse</a>.</p>

<p>I have an amazing family, including my beautiful wife Amy, my
two-year-old son, Brody, and a new baby girl, Grace.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing music for about 10 years. I dabble in a lot of different
instruments but my true love is the electric guitar. I’ve played with
some fellow musicians on a few different projects (mostly for fun), but
my heart is in worship. I am apart of music ministry at a church called
<a href="http://lifepointoakdale.org">LifePoint</a> in Oakdale, CA and it’s
something about which I’m extremely passionate.</p>

<p>This is my blog where you’ll find my rantings usually surrounding these
three topics.</p>
