<p>I’m an information junky. I spend hours a day on <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>,
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, <a href="http://usevim.com">UseVim</a>, <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com">Giant
Robots</a>, <a href="http://dailyjs.com">DailyJS</a> — if
it’s about developer-anything, I’m there. So I decided to share the wealth of
links that I visit on a daily basis with the world.</p>

<p>Introducing <strong>spamthe.net</strong> — my very own link spammer. Follow on twitter
(<a href="http://twitter.com/spamthenet">@spamthenet</a>), bookmark in your browser
(<a href="http://spamthe.net">spamthe.net</a>) *, subscribe to the weekly newsletter
(<a href="http://spamthe.net">here</a>), or join the IRC channel on Freenode
(<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net">#spamthenet</a>).</p>

<p>The links themselves can be found easily by anyone else who is as obsessed
with the above-mentioned resources as I am. But the fun part was building it.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> to host the site and a node.js
app to update twitter and the blog simultaneously. Oh, and I wrote a
bookmarklet so that I can just click a button from within a site and send it to
the spammer.</p>

<p>The node app listens for a request (CORS of course) from the
bookmarklet. The title and url are passed in the request, and the app
posts to the twitter account and writes a new file into the website’s repo,
commits, and pushes to GitHub. Now I can share links with the click of a
button. Copy + paste is so 2013.</p>

<p>The IRC channel is running a version of <a href="http://hubot.github.io">hubot</a> that
listens to spamthenet’s Twitter stream and auto-posts the links.
Join the channel if you feel like chatting with cool people while you wait for
the links to pour in.</p>

<p>Also don’t forget to bookmark <a href="http://spamthe.net">spamthe.net</a>, sign up for
our newsletter, follow <a href="http://spamthe.net">@spamthenet</a>, and join us on IRC.
Or maybe just one of those, if you feel doing all of them would be redundant.</p>

<p>* I know the site has spam in the title. So here’s a screenshot for all you out
there who are too scared to actually click on the link:</p>
