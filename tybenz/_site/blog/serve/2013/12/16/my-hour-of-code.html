<p>This past week was <a href="http://code.org">code.org’s</a> first <a href="http://csedweek.org">Computer Science Education Week</a>. They set a goal of getting 10 million students worldwide to participate
in an hour of code (they ended up with over 16 million). Code.org and many other participating organizations created self-guided tutorials to walk students through the fundamentals
of programming.</p>

<p>I was able to help out at a <a href="http://hcs.hickmanschools.org">Hickman Charter School</a> by adding a short presentation on what code is all about. I’m extremely appreciative of
code.org’s efforts to educate young people on such an important topic. Here’s some photos from the event:</p>
