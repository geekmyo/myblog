<p>I thought I’d write a quick post about what I used to create this blog.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>: Static site generator</li>
  <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>: CSS preprocessor</li>
  <li><a href="http://bourbon.io">Bourbon</a>: Set of generic Sass mixins</li>
  <li><a href="http://neat.bourbon.io">Neat</a>: Set of grid-based Sass mixins (dependent on Bourbon)</li>
  <li>Fonts: <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bebas-neue">Bebas Neue</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adobe/source-sans-pro">Adobe Source Sans Pro</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adobe/source-code-pro">Adobe Source Code Pro</a></li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re not using Github Pages and Jekyll yet, get cracking. There is
nothing I love more than to write a post in markdown, deploy it with
git, and have the whole thing hosted for free!</p>

<p>Sass just makes life better. There are far too many vendor prefixes to
deal with these days. And Sass makes styling quick and painless.</p>

<p>Bourbon and Neat are my new favorite mixin library. The guys at
Thoughtbot are always doing some great things, but this small, intuitive
mixin and grid system just works.</p>

<p>The Adobe fonts have become my new favorite defaults. Bebas is just a
great headings fault, similar to din. I’m in love.</p>

<p>Well that about wraps it up. The list is pretty short and I’m extremely
happy with the results. Thanks for reading.</p>
