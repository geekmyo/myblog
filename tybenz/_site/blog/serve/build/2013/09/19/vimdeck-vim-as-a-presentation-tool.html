<p>I made a thing. It’s called <a href="https://raw.github.com/tybenz/vimdeck/master/img/demo3.png">Vimdeck</a>
and it lets you write a presentation
in a single markdown file and then converts that file into multiple “slides”
to be opened and shared in VIM.</p>

<p>Buffers as slides. Genius, no? Plus, I added some ascii art conversion stuff too.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="http://github.com/tybenz/vimdeck">GitHub page</a> to check it out.</p>
